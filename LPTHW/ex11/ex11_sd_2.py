# Other way to use input()

age = input("How old are you? ")
height = input("How tall are you? ")
weight = input("How much do you weigh? ")
print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")

Output:

python ex11_sd_2.py                              
How old are you? 21
How tall are you? 70.8
How much do you weigh? 121.254
So, you're 21 old, 70.8 tall and 121.254 heavy.
